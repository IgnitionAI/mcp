### How to Get LinkedIn API Keys
To obtain the necessary LinkedIn API credentials (`LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID`, `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI`), follow these steps:

1. **Create a LinkedIn Developer Account**  
   Visit [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/) and log in with your LinkedIn account.

2. **Create a New App**  
   Click **Create app**, fill out the required details, and submit.

3. **Get Client ID and Client Secret**  
   After creating the app, navigate to the **Auth** or **Settings** tab to find your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

4. **Set Redirect URI**  
   In the appâ€™s **OAuth 2.0 settings**, add your redirect URL (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/auth/linkedin/callback`). Use this URL as your `LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI`.

Make sure to create the `env` file, based on the given `.env.example`.

### Run the MCP HTTP Server
